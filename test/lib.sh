# Call `harness_init <name>`: sets HERE (the repo root, so a test reaches
# bin/, install, systemd/), a private scratch dir T (removed on exit), and the
# pass/fail helpers. Everything a test touches is confined to T; nothing outside
# it is written. POSIX sh; run one with `sh test/<name>.t`, all with test/run.
